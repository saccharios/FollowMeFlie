# FollowMeFlie

The goal of this project is to mount a mini camera on the CrazyFlie 2.0 and have it follow a target object.

The app is a client for the CrazyFlie 2.0 programmed in C++ for windows. I use with QT for the GUI and opencv for the image processing.

Check out this [video](https://youtu.be/gP_Cj_Js5NY) of the CrazyFlie and the client.

Check under "Projects" on what I am currently working on.
