# FollowMeFlie

Client for the CrazyFlie 2.0 programmed in C++ with QT.

The goal is to add a mini-camera to the CrazyFlie and let it follow a colored-object.

A short summary of what is implemented is in docs/What_is_implemented.docx and a short summary of what I am working on is in docs/What_is_missing.docx
